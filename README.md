# Dynamic-Programming

Dynamic Programming is technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have **overlapping** and **optimal substructure** property.

> DP is **Optimized** recursion.

### How to **identify** DP?

a. Optimal Problem
b. some choice is given (multiple branches in recursion tree)

### Ways of DP

1. Memoization (Top Down)

> step:-1 **Rucursion** --> step:-02 Divided **Sub-problems** --> sub-problems store in **storage** in arr. --> when need **Reuse** this value don't calculate again...

2. Tabulation(Bottom Up)
   > step:-1 **iteration** --> step:- store in form table/set/storage.
